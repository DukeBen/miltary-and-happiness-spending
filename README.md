# Project Purpose
In a group project with three friends, we explored the impact of military spending on citizen happiness, given the polarizing opinions on this subject. Some argue that heavy military investment is crucial for national security, while others believe that these funds could be better allocated to social programs directly benefiting citizens, such as homelessness relief or medicare expansion.

We hypothesized that military expenditure would influence population happiness levels. Our project focused on determining the nature and direction of this correlation. Additionally, we examined the relationships between military spending and factors contributing to happiness, including government trust, life expectancy, and perceived freedom.

Throughout history, military spending has been associated with government corruption, affecting public trust. It can also indirectly influence health programs and citizens' sense of national security, which may correlate with feelings of freedom. By analyzing these relationships, we aimed to reveal the nuanced impact of military spending on various aspects of population happiness.

# Research Question: 
Does military spending as a percentage of GDP have a positive, negative, or insignificant correlation with a country’s overall happiness? Does military spending correlate to more specific factors of happiness, such as freedom, health expectancy, and government trust? Are those factors of happiness strongly correlated with overall happiness or are they more inelastic?

# Datasets Used:
1:  “Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020” 
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Elias Turk, License: CC0: Public Domain
This dataset provides information about the population’s overall happiness by country by aggregating all valid data for countries with existent data from the year 2015 to 2020. The dataset provides specific columns to outline the factors that contributed to the overall happiness score. This dataset was immensely useful in comparing the overall happiness and its contributing factors between countries. By analyzing this data, we looked for a correlations in the happiness scores with increases in military spending.  

2:“Military Spending of Countries (1960-2019)” 
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Nitin Singh, License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) 
Consolidated from The World Bank Database, this dataset provides the military expenditure (in USD) of over 200 countries from 1960-2019. We analyzed this dataset alongside the “Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020” dataset, and analyzed the countries with large or small military expenditures and merged the datasets to find any correlation to overall happiness.

3: “World GDP (GDP, GDP per capita, and annual growths”
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Ozgur Cem Tas, License: CC0 – Public Domain
	This dataset contains the overall GDP per country from 1960-2020. We utilized this dataset along with the “Military Spending of Countries (1960-2019)” dataset to calculate the percentage of military expenditure relative to GDP. This calculation allowed us to analyze military expenditure relative to overall GDP to account for differences in the size and economy of countries.
	
# Results:
We found no clear correlation between military spending as a function of overall GDP and a country's happiness.
