# miltary-spending-and-happiness
This was a group project between my 3 friends and I.  We recognized there has been increasing political polarization regarding government funding for the military.  An argument from the right is that we need to heavily invest in the military for national security purposes.  The left’s counter argument is that governments should be spending more of the military budget on programs that more directly affect their citizens – such as aiding the homeless or increasing medicare. These programs directly affect the well-being of citizens, but also a country’s national security also casts its own influence over a population’s sentiments. Thus, we hypothesized that military spending should have an effect on the population’s level of happiness. In our project, we first investigated whether the amount of money a government spends on their military is correlated to the overall happiness of its citizens, and if that correlation is positive or negative. 
Moreover, a population’s happiness relies on numerous factors, such as perceptions of government corruption, widespread generosity, family, life expectancy, and more. Military spending has often been linked to government corruption throughout history and can positively or negatively change the population’s trust in its government. Military spending also has an indirect impact on health programs, as explained above. Moreover, the sense of national security from military spending may prove correlated to the sentiments of freedom. Thus, military spending has possible correlations to these contributing facets of happiness: government trust, life expectancy, and freedom. Analyzing these correlations will reveal the impact military spending has on specific facets of a population’s happiness.

# Research Question: 
Does military spending as a percentage of GDP have a positive, negative, or insignificant correlation with a country’s overall happiness? Does military spending correlate to more specific factors of happiness, such as freedom, health expectancy, and government trust? Are those factors of happiness strongly correlated with overall happiness or are they more inelastic?

We looked at the following three datasets from Kaggle:
1:  “Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020” 
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Elias Turk, License: CC0: Public Domain
This dataset provides information about the population’s overall happiness by country by aggregating all valid data for countries with existent data from the year 2015 to 2020. The dataset provides specific columns to outline the factors that contributed to the overall happiness score. This dataset was immensely useful in comparing the overall happiness and its contributing factors between countries. By analyzing this data, we looked for a correlations in the happiness scores with increases in military spending.  
2:“Military Spending of Countries (1960-2019)” 
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Nitin Singh, License: Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License (CC BY 4.0) 
Consolidated from The World Bank Database, this dataset provides the military expenditure (in USD) of over 200 countries from 1960-2019. We analyzed this dataset alongside the “Happiness and Corruption 2015-2020” dataset, and analyzed the countries with large or small military expenditures and merged the datasets to find any correlation to overall happiness.
3: “World GDP (GDP, GDP per capita, and annual growths”
Type: csv, Kaggle Ownership: Ozgur Cem Tas, License: CC0 – Public Domain
	This dataset contains the overall GDP per country from 1960-2020. We utilized this dataset along with the “Military Spending of Countries (1960-2019)” dataset to calculate the percentage of military expenditure relative to GDP. This calculation allowed us to analyze military expenditure relative to overall GDP to account for differences in the size and economy of countries.
	
# Results:
We found no clear correlation between military spending as a function of overall GDP and a country's happiness.
